# LUC Course Evaluation Web-App


## About
This project was created for the student of Loyola University Chicago for them to read student written reviews about course provided at loyola. Students can use this as a resource to find classes that they believe they can succeed most in. 

Students provide extensive experience about past classes so future students can use their review to their benefit.
